A small festive single-page site with snowfall effect and simple navigation.

What's added/changed:

Slightly improved styling (gentle gradient, button polish).
Background music support via script.js and a small Music toggle button on the homepage.
Background music usage

Place an MP3 file at assets/bgm.mp3 (create an assets folder at the project root).
The music toggle button (Music OFF / Music ON) will remember your preference using localStorage.
Note: Browsers typically block autoplay; music will start after a user gesture if enabled.
